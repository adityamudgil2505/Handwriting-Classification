## Skills used
- Python3
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV

### The k-Nearest Neighbor Classifier
The k-Nearest Neighbor classifier is by far the most simple image classification algorithm. In fact, it’s so simple that it doesn’t actually “learn” anything! Instead, this algorithm simply relies on the distance between feature vectors.
